<p> Hello, this is my irst <b>HTML assignment</b> page. <br> In 
    this page I will include a few of my hobbies and <br> future 
    goals.</p>

    <!--I included page breaks to keep my text more 
        compact-->

    <h2 class="center">HOBBIES</h2> 
<p>Being a Boise (GO <abbr title="Boise State University">BSU</abbr>) native, 
    you could assume that I am most likely 
    and outdoorsy person. Well...I very much am. I love hiking, fishing, 
    kayaking, playing sports, biking, camping, and tailgating</p>
    <p>Being such an outdoorsy person, I love being able to drive 
        30 minutes into the moutains and be totally away from the 
        city. It makes being spontaneous extremely easy. If you're 
        ever bored, you got options that include
       <ul>
            <li>going to table rock</li> <br>

            <li>hiking near bogus</li> <br>
            <img src="sunset-3325080_1920.jpg">
            <li>fishing the boise river</li> <br>
            <img src="fishing-1245979_1920.jpg">
            <li>walking down 6th and idaho street</li> <br>
            <img src="city-407703_1920.jpg">
            <li>checking out the capital</li> <br>
            <img src="capital-5043172_1920.jpg">
            <li> going to Space Bar</li> <br>
            <img src="bar-209148_1920.jpg">
            <li>driving to lucky peak lake</li> <br>
            <img src="mountains-1761292_1920.jpg">
            <li>going to a <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/boise/recarea/?recid=5199">

        </ul>  
        <!--These codes are photos of each of my hobbies. Because I had to 
        outside of class, I unfortunately wasn't able to check the sizes of 
    each photo. I will fix the sizes to be more appealing to the veiwer when
I get a chance-->
        <h1> Hot Springs in Idaho</h1>
       <p> ....and many many more options. I like to often 
        be spontaneous and live by the quote <em><q>Live every day like 
            it could be your last</q></em></p>
    <p>Another important fact about myself, aside from my hobbies, 
        include my huge love for sports. It doesn't matter what sport,
         as long as it's competitive, I will watch and enjoy it. Whether
          it's football, baseball, , volleyball, softball, 
          corhole, ect. I absolutely love it. Although I watch it all,
           I do have some favorites. My favorite sports to watch are
            baseball, basketball, football, and tennis. I do have some 
            favorites in these sports as well </p>

            <dt> Baseball:</dt>
            <dd> <span style="color: blue">Seattle Mariners</span> </dd>
            <dt>Football:</dt>
            <dd> <span style="color: silver" >Seattle Seahawks</span></dd>
            <dt> Basketball:</dt>
            <dd><span style="color: lime">Dallas Mavericks</span></dd> 
            <dt>Tennis:</dt>
            <dd><span style="color: yellow">Naomi Osaka</span></dd>
        </dl>
       
        <p> Aside from professional football, along with the Seattle 
            Seahawks, I also love the Boise State Broncos. If you don't
            happen to know what a bronco is, it's defined as a wild 
            bucking horse. Often looking like this:<br><video width="320" height="240" controls>

            <!--This was my favorite part of my assignment. I am a huge
            BSU fan so it was cool to insert this little snipet of a group of 
        wild horses-->
        
      <p><br><br>Not only because I am a student there currently but because I grew 
            up since day one being a fan and I was taught to dislike 
            the Vandals from Moscow
